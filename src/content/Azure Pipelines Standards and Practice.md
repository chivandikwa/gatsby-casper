# Azure Pipelines - Standards and Practices

‚úÖ **DO** create pipelines in YAML committed in the relevant project repository and not via the classic UI approach or CLI.

‚úÖ **DO** add shared variables to a variable group to avoid duplicated variables across various pipelines.

> Add only truly global variables, that is any for which you would require the same value for all pipelines that use this without the need to customize for a single pipeline. An API key to a third-party service or a license key is a good example.

‚úÖ **DO** leverage integrations to services like `Azure Key Vault` for managing user secrets and using those in pipeline runs.

‚úÖ **DO** store `secret` variables with `Keep this value as secret` enabled. The default would be for Azure DevOps to store variables as raw text.

> Always ensure your secrets are stored securely and aren't hardcoded in your pipeline.

‚úÖ **DO** favour parameters over variables for scenarios where you have a finite list of values as parameters will make use of a radio button group or dropdown for convenience.

‚úÖ **DO** maintain an extensive retention policy for pipeline runs. This is important to track run history over an extensive period for example to see if test run performance is regressing, linting cleanups are on track, and the addition of tests in the solution is healthy.

‚úÖ **DO** have a clear naming convention for your pipelines, making it easy to identify the type of pipeline (CI or CD), the target environment, and the project being built.

Here's an example of an Azure Pipelines naming standard:

  - Build pipelines: build-{projectName}
  - Release pipelines: release-{projectName}-{environmentName}
  - Deployment pipelines: deploy-{projectName}-{environmentName}
  - Infrastructure pipelines: infra-{infrastructureType}-{projectName}-{environmentName}

Here's a breakdown of each component of the naming standard:

  - {projectName}: the name of the project being built, deployed, or tested.
  - {environmentName}: the name of the environment being deployed or released to.
  - {infrastructureType}: the type of infrastructure being deployed or managed, such as aks for Azure   Kubernetes Service or appsvc for Azure App Service.
  {testType}: the type of test being run, such as unit, integration, or end-to-end.
  - {platform}: the platform being tested on, such as linux-x64 or windows-x64.

By following a consistent naming standard like this, it's easier to quickly identify and locate the pipelines you need within Azure DevOps.

‚úÖ **DO** use templates to share pipeline configuration across projects. This ensures consistency in pipeline design and makes it easier to maintain pipelines.

‚úÖ **DO** implement checks such as quality gates, code coverage requirements, and security scans as part of the pipeline.

‚úÖ **DO** have a clear and concise description of what the pipeline is doing and include any relevant links to documentation or related systems.

‚úÖ **DO** have a clear and concise description of what the pipeline is doing and include any relevant links to documentation or related systems.

‚úÖ **DO** split long-running jobs across multiple stages. This promotes visibility and enables progress reporting as each stage is completed. Make sure any dependencies between stages are required to avoid unnecessary waits in the runs.

‚úÖ **DO** make use of the appropriate pool directive for agents to help reduce build times by ensuring the build does not wait for an agent to become available.

‚úÖ **DO** ensure that your deployment scripts are idempotent, i.e., running the script multiple times should not produce unexpected/different results.

‚úÖ **DO** favour explicit versions of SDKs and other tooling in your pipelines. For example explicit node versions, .NET SDK versions or Bicep versions.

‚úÖ **DO** make use of the appropriate pool directive for agents to help reduce build times by ensuring the build does not wait for an agent to become available.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Microsoft frequently updates these images with the latest available tooling, bugfixes and patches. You can also specify a specific version for reproducibility reasons, especially when you want to maintain compatibility with certain libraries or frameworks.

‚úÖ **DO** have separate pipelines for CI/CD. This separation makes it easy to change the deployment strategy without affecting the build process.

‚úÖ **DO** modularize your pipelines into templates for stages, jobs or steps once they start to become large or very focused. This makes things more manageable and readable, also opening up reuse potential.

> Once you have the same logic copied across multiple pipelines this is often the smell that you could do with a template.

üéá **DO** consider making use of caching to speed up pipelines by avoiding unnecessary computation or downloads. For example, by hashing a node package lock JSON file as a cache key, you can avoid doing a node install when the packages have not changed and are available in a cache.

üéá **DO** consider making use of pipeline artefacts to make resources from one pipeline run available to another for download to speed up pipelines by doing certain computations or downloads once.

> A key deciding factor between caching and artefacts is whether or not the artefacts are optional or mandatory. If optional use a cache, else artifacts.

‚úÖ **DO** that you only publish required artefacts to keep your pipelines lean.

‚úÖ **DO** that you only download required artefacts to keep your pipelines lean.

üéá **DO** consider comments in your pipelines for things that may not be easy to understand. However, avoid commenting on every single line and assume a basic understanding of Azure Pipelines as a prerequisite for any reader.

üéá **DO** consider built-in tasks, particularly platform-independent ones to increase the portability of your pipelines over using things like PowerShell tasks.

üéá **DO** consider condition-based stages to optimize your pipelines by not executing stages that are not required based off set conditional logic.

‚úÖ **DO** ensure you have monitoring and alerting in place for your pipelines, so you can be notified when something goes wrong.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A healthy build and deployment process is only as good as the monitoring and alerting in place. Ensure that you have appropriate notifications and reporting in place so that you can quickly identify and remediate any issues that arise

‚õî **DO NOT** expose secrets via logs in the pipeline runs or to any unauthorized users.

‚õî **DO NOT** use pipeline variables to store sensitive data such as secrets, keys, or passwords. Instead, use Azure Key Vault or a similar secure storage service.

‚õî **DO NOT** create overly complex pipelines with unnecessary steps or dependencies. This can lead to longer build times and an increased risk of failure. Keep pipelines simple and focused on the task at hand.

‚õî **DO NOT** use scripts or code snippets in your pipeline without proper testing and validation. This can introduce security vulnerabilities or errors that are difficult to diagnose

# Splits long-running jobs across multiple stages
# Uses the appropriate agent pool to reduce build times
# Has a separate pipeline for CI and CD
