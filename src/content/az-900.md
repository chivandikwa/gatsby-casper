# Introduction

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform.
- Offers a wide range of services for simple and complex business solutions.
- Provides web services for hosting business presence in the cloud.
- Supports fully virtualized computers for custom software solutions.
- Provides cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management.
- Offers new capabilities like AI and IoT services.

# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing delivers IT services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
-Services include infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.
- Cloud services also offer new capabilities like IoT, ML, and AI.
- Cloud computing is not constrained by physical infrastructure like traditional datacenters.
- Cloud computing allows for rapid IT expansion without building new datacenters.

Basic services
- Compute
- Storage

!!Why not networking?

## Shared responsibility model

Traditional data center management
- Physical space
- Mantaining/replacing servers
- Backups
- Updates/patches/correct version
- Physical security
- Resource redundancy (electricity, network access, cooling)

The shared responsibility model splits responsibilities between cloud provider and consumer.
- Cloud provider is responsible for physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity.
- Consumer is responsible for data, information, access security in the cloud

Some things are situational i.e
- Responsibility for database patches and updates
  - on a managed cloud SQL DB falls to the cloud provider.
  - on an unmanaged virtual machine with SQL falls to the consumer.

Summary
- Cloud computing shifts responsibilities compared to on-premises datacenters.
- Shared responsibility model is tied to cloud service types: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
- IaaS places more responsibility on consumer, while SaaS places more responsibility on cloud provider.
- PaaS falls somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility.

## Cloud models

3 main
- private
- public
- hybrid

Private cloud
- Private cloud is the evolution from a corporate datacenter.
- It's used by a single entity, providing greater control for the company and its IT department.
- Private cloud comes with greater cost and fewer benefits than public cloud deployment.
- Private cloud can be hosted onsite or offsite in a dedicated datacenter, potentially by a third party.

Public cloud
- Public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
- Anyone can access and use resources with a public cloud.
- Public cloud resources are generally available to the general public.
- Public cloud differs from private cloud in terms of general availability.

Hybrid cloud
- A hybrid cloud uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.
- Hybrid cloud can be used to allow private cloud to surge for increased temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.
- Hybrid cloud provides an extra layer of security, allowing users to choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to private cloud infrastructure.

| Public cloud                                                          | Private cloud                                                      | Hybrid cloud                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No capital expenditures to scale up                                   | Organizations have complete control over resources and security    | Provides the most flexibility                                     |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned             | Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data              | Organizations determine where to run their applications           |
| Organizations pay only for what they use                              | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance             | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates |                                                                   |


| **Cloud Type** | **Advantages**                                     | **Disadvantages**                                       |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public Cloud   | No capex, quick provisioning, pay-as-you-go        | Limited control over resources and security             |
| Private Cloud  | Complete control over resources and security       | Capex for startup and maintenance, data not collocated  |
| Hybrid Cloud   | Most flexibility, choose where to run applications | Complex to manage, responsible for hardware maintenance |

Multi cloud
- Multi-cloud is a scenario where multiple public cloud providers are used.
- Different features from different cloud providers may be used, or there may be a migration process between providers.
- In a multi-cloud environment, resources and security must be managed in both environments.

## Managing multiple cloud types with Azure

Azure Arc
- Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
- Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Azure VMware Solution
- Allows you to run your existing VMware workloads in a private cloud that you want to migrate to a public cloud in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

## Consumption based model

Two types of expenses in IT infrastructure models: CapEx and OpEx.
- CapEx is a one-time, up-front expense for tangible resources.
- OpEx is spending on services or products over time.
- Cloud computing is OpEx, operating on a consumption-based model. Pay only for the IT resources used; no payment for physical  infrastructure, electricity, or security.

Benefits of consumption-based model in cloud computing:
- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that might not be used to its fullest potential.
- Ability to pay for more resources when needed.
- Ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Traditional datacenters require estimation of future resource needs, leading to potential waste or decreased performance.
- Under-provisioned datacenters can take time to fix with added hardware, power, cooling, and networking.
- Cloud-based models provide flexible resource allocation without worrying about getting it just right.
- Add or remove virtual machines as needed without paying for extra capacity.
- Pay only for the virtual machines that you use.


# Benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

Two key considerations for cloud applications: uptime/availability and ability to handle demand/scale.
- Availability refers to how long the application is available and running without interruption.
- High availability means minimizing downtime to ensure the application is always accessible.
- Demand refers to how much usage the application is handling, and scalability refers to the ability to handle an increase in demand.
- Scaling helps in adding or removing resources to handle increased or decreased demand.
- Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal.
  - Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.
  - Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
- Scaling helps in optimizing resource usage and **reducing costs**
- Cloud services offer scalable options, including auto-scaling, which automatically adjusts resources based on demand.
  - Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are included in the service-level agreements (SLAs).
